# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard uses the open weather map API to show basic weather info on a searched city. This dashboard consists of a current weather card with the city name, today’s date, an icon representation of weather conditions, and some other basic weather information on the card, and a 5 day weather forecast. 

All searched cities are saved in a button under the search button, and users can access the previously searched city’s weather info any time.
